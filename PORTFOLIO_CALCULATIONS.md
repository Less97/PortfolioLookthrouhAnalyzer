2. **Look-Through Revenue**: The total of ~$183K represents your proportional economic exposure to the underlying companies' revenue streams.

3. **Look-Through Earnings**: The ~$39K in free cash flow represents your share of the companies' earnings power.

6. **Profit Margin**: The 21.5% aggregate margin reflects the high-quality, profitable companies in the portfolio.
